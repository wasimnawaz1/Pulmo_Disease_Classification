Pulmo Disease Classification
A deep learning project for the non-contact diagnosis of respiratory diseases using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals.

üåü Project Overview
This project introduces a novel, non-contact method for the classification of common respiratory diseases. Using a software-defined radio (SDR), a 5.23 GHz OFDM signal with 64 frequencies is transmitted through a patient's lungs. The unique breathing patterns associated with different diseases modulate this signal, which is then analyzed by a deep learning model to classify the patient's condition. This approach lays the foundation for non-invasive, AI-powered diagnostic tools in future 6G-enabled healthcare environments.

üóÇÔ∏è The OFDM-Breathe Dataset
This work is based on the OFDM-Breathe dataset, the first of its kind. It comprises 26,760 seconds of raw RF data collected from 220 subjects in a hospital setting. The dataset is categorized into six distinct classes:

üöÄ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/wasimnawaz1/Pulmo_Disease_Classification.git
cd Pulmo_Disease_Classification

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üìù Usage
Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, run the [Training Script Name] script:

python [script_name].py

Running Inference
