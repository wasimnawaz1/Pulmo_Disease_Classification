# Pulmo Disease Classification
A deep learning project to classify pulmonary diseases from chest X-ray images. This repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🌟 Project Overview
This project aims to automatically classify common pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia, from chest X-ray images. The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing a fast and efficient tool for initial diagnosis, reducing the burden on radiologists and potentially saving lives. 

Main stages of this project, Disease Monitoring and Classification using Non-Contact and Non-Invasive 6G ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication), include: 
 1. Data collection →
 2. Dataset preprocessing and signal processing
 3. ML/DL modeling
 4. evaluation

🗂️ Dataset
The model is trained on the [Dataset Name] dataset, which consists of chest X-ray images categorized into [Number] classes: [Class 1], [Class 2], [Class 3], etc.

Total Images: [Total number of images]

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
This project uses the following key technologies and libraries:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Pandas: For data handling and analysis.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For model evaluation metrics.

🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/wasimnawaz1/Pulmo_Disease_Classification.git
cd Pulmo_Disease_Classification

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can manually install the libraries listed above.)

📝 Usage
Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, run the [Training Script Name] script:

python [script_name].py

Running Inference
To use the trained model for prediction on a new image, use the [Inference Script Name] script:

python [script_name].py --image_path "path/to/your/image.jpg"

📈 Model Performance
The final model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy: [Accuracy Score]%

Precision: [Precision Score]%

Recall: [Recall Score]%

F1-Score: [F1-Score]%
